          <h2>The Poet With The Golden Heart</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Devkota was born on the night of Lakshmi Puja on 13 November 1909 (27 Kartik 1966 BS)
            to father Teel Madhav Devkota and mother Amar Rajya Lakshmi Devi in Dhobidhara,
            Kathmandu. His father was a Sanskrit scholar, so he attained his basic education
            under the custodianship of his father. He started his formal education at Durbar 
            High School, where he studied both Sanskrit grammar and English. After finishing 
            his matriculation exams from Patna at the age of 17, he pursued a Bachelor of Arts
            along with a Bachelor of Laws at Tri-Chandra College and graduated from Patna University 
            as a private examinee. His desire to complete his master's degree was left incomplete due
            to his family's financial conditions.</b>
